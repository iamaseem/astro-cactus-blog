If you don’t know I’m a backend engineer by profession. In free time I explore random stuff related to my field. Some time ago I learned Go for the first time I really like the idea of golang and the people behind it.

My first impression was A C like language and I’m very confused with the missing of classes. Any way I’m happy because I can related so-many things like functions and data types etc.

But when I started to explore the backend framework gin the story is different.

At that time I was coding in express(NodeJS) so I’m familiar with the minimal framework but the problem was with

```go
c, err := upgrader.Upgrade(w, r, nil)
	if err != nil {
		log.Println("upgrade:", err)
		return
	}
```

This line that says `if err != nil` not acceptable by my brain

Why this like that I’m very confused and at the same time I started to read about the bad garbage collector and also number of medium post about the bad performance comparing to other languages. Just like that I stopped learning (Actually switch some other tech)
