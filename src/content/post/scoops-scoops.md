## Clean Code

I just started to read the [Two Scoops Of Django](https://www.feldroy.com/books/two-scoops-of-django-3-x) and the first section is all about **Clean Code** for Django and python.
The Python core team and Django core team spend so much effort to make and improving standards like [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) and [Django Code Style](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/internals/contributing/writing-code/coding-style/)

The book covers essential coding styles and good practice to follow when coding in general and some django specific elements and tips. They also go the extra miles to cover the HTML, CSS and JS coding patterns.

There is a huge load of extra reading to cover that yet to be covered.
