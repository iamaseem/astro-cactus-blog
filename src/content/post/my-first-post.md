## A blogging system

I been working on making a complete blogging system since I was in
second year from scratch.
But theres been a several technologies and iteration for this dream.
Now a days I was thinking \*\*Why To Reinvent The Wheel Every Time\*\* rather than building from scratch its better to take a template and build on top of it and also contribute to it when feel like some thing is missing.

I choose the [Astro Cactus Theme](https://github.com/chrismwilliams/astro-theme-cactus) with Astro and SolidJS only reason is performance and easy to use because of similarity with ReactJS
